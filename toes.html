	<p>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		Toes are bony digits located at the end of the foot. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, just like us. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Function</h2>
		Toes serve a critical role in balance and walking. Thats why we cram them into shoes with narrow toe bases to make them less effective. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		Toes develop in the womb just like every other part of the body. Literally all growth is pretty much the same.
