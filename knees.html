		<h2>Structure</h2>
		Knees are like hinges that connect your upper and lower legs. They allow you to do cool things like walk, run, and dance the Macarena.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Function</h2>
		Knees are the MVPs of your legs. They absorb shock when you jump and protect you when you fall (unless you're me...). Without knees, you'd be like a <span style="color: pink;">flamingo</span> -- but less fabulous.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		Knees start off as tiny bumps on your fetal legs, and then they grow and develop into big bumps on your adult legs. It's like a caterpillar turning into a beautiful butterfly, except less pretty and more useful.
