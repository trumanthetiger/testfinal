	<h1>SHOULDERS</h1>
	<p>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		Shoulders are a part of the body that is uniquely suited to shrugging. They are located between the head and the knees, and are often used to carry heavy bags, wear backpacks, and generally support the weight of the world on your shoulders. Cool, huh?
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Function</h2>
		The primary function of shoulders is to allow the arms to move in a wide range of directions. Without shoulders, we would not be able to perform many everyday tasks, such as reaching for objects, hugging loved ones, or scratching that itch on our backs.
	</p>

		<h2>Development</h2>
Similar to heads, shoulder's are created when you are born. So <i>Cool!</i>
